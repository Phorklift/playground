Here comment starts.

`echo` accepts a table which consists of a string array member
to define response body, and some key-value options, such as the
`status_code` in this example.
In last example (01.hello_world) it accepts just a string value,
which is a syntactic sugar. See `doc/3.conf_tutorial.md` for more
details.
