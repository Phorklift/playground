Playground
</H1>

<P>
Welcome to <A HREF="https://github.com/Phorklift/phorklift">Phorklift</A> configuration playground!
Phorklift is an HTTP server/proxy daemon with clear, powerful and dynamic configuration.
This playground let you to try the configuration online!

<P>
If you are here for the first time, it's better to begin with some examples.
Select one at the <b>Examples</b> selector, <b>Upload</b> it, <b>Send</b> request
to test, and checkout the response.
Then try to modify them. Do not forget to <b>Upload</b> before testing.

<P>
If you want to modify more or write your own configuration, you may need to read
some documents, including
<A HREF="https://github.com/Phorklift/phorklift/blob/main/doc/3.conf_tutorial.md">configuration tutorial</A>,
<A HREF="https://github.com/Phorklift/phorklift/blob/main/doc/4.conf_reference.md">configuration reference</A> and
<A HREF="https://github.com/Phorklift/phorklift/blob/main/doc/5.lua_api_reference.md">Lua API reference</A>.

You will find that a complete Phorklift configuration always
begins with <i>Listen()</i> to define listen address. While each example here
is just a Lua table.
The reason is that this playground is powered by Phorklift's dynamic-Path
configuration. All you need to provide is just a Lua table as <i>Path()</i>'s
definition, and it's created dynamicly and run in the same Phorklift process
with the playground itself, which is similar to service-discovery.
You can find out how this works from its <A HREF="https://github.com/Phorklift/playground">configuration</A>,
which is also a typical example of Phorklift's dynamic configuration.
If you want to try a complete configuration, you have to run Phorklift yourself.

<P>
Generally speaking, the dynamic configurations are always provided by trusted source.
You are trusted now. Do not be evil! However there are still some interesting
challenges, such as exploring my filesystem or buiding a nested playground.

<P>
Feel free to file a Github <A HREF="https://github.com/Phorklift/phorklift/issues">issue</A>
for any question or idea.
<P>
Enjoy it!
